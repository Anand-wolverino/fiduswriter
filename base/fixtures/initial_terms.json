The Company's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Company's visitors use its website. From time to time, the Company may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\r\n\r\nThe Company also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Website.

The amount and type of information that the Company gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at\u00a0the Website\u00a0to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with the Company are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, the Company collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with the Company. The Company does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.\r\n<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>\r\nThe Company may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Company's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. The Company will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, the Company discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when the Company believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the Company, third parties or the public at large.
